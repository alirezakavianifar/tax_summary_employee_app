# Agent Instructions

## Git Remote

Changes must be pushed to:

**https://github.com/alirezakavianifar/tax_summary_employee_app.git**

Ensure the remote `origin` points to this URL. If not configured, use: `git remote add origin https://github.com/alirezakavianifar/tax_summary_employee_app.git` (or `git remote set-url origin <url>` to update).

## .gitignore

If `.gitignore` does not exist, create one based on the codebase structure and language. Adapt entries to match the project's technologies and build output locations.

## File Creation Policy

**NEVER create markdown (.md) files unless the user explicitly requests it.** This includes documentation files, README files, plan files, or any other .md files. Only create markdown files when the user specifically asks for them.

## Git Push Workflow

When the user uses the keyword "push" in a request (e.g., "please push these changes", "push", or similar), you MUST follow this specific workflow:

1. **Stage all changes**: standard `git add .`
2. **Infer Commit Message**: Generate a concise, descriptive, and professional commit message based on the recent file changes and conversation context. Do not ask the user for a commit message unless they explicitly provide one.
3. **Commit**: `git commit -m "<inferred_message>"`
4. **Push**: `git push` (or `git push -u origin <branch>` if the upstream is not set).

**Note:** You should proactively execute these commands without asking for extra confirmation if the user explicitly said "push".
